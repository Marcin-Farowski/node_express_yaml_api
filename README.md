## How to run:

Inside **node_express_yaml_api** folder run command `npm install`.

Then run command `npm start`.

By default, application is running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

*If you want to make some changes in .ts files, please remember to run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript files into
JavaScript files before every `npm start`.*

*You can use `npm run dev` - this command supports hot reloads, and it runs application from TypeScript files.*
